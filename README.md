Data Visualization: Query results are displayed in tabular format with optional charts for better analysis.

Query Categories:

GUVI Provided Queries: Predefined queries for common retail analysis tasks like revenue generation, profit margins, and total discounts.

Self-Defined Queries: Custom queries for deeper insights, such as unique products sold per city or revenue by product category.


Database Integration: Seamlessly connects to a PostgreSQL database, ensuring real-time data retrieval and analysis.

User-Friendly UI: Intuitive interface for selecting and executing queries, powered by Streamlit.


Technologies Used:

Streamlit: For building the interactive dashboard.

PostgreSQL: Database for storing and querying retail data.

Python: For query execution and data processing (pandas, psycopg2).


This tool is ideal for retail businesses looking to leverage their data for strategic decision-making.
